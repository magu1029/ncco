Or I can break based on different strength. The <say-as interpret-as="spell-out">phoneme</say-as> tag allows you to send an International Phonetic Alphabet representation of a word. For example, my name Lu Meng should be pronouced as <phoneme alphabet='ipa' ph='lʊi:məŋ'>Lu Meng</phoneme>. Next, the prosody tag allows you to set the pitch, rate and volume of the text. I can speak <prosody volume='x-loud'>very loud</prosody> or to speak <prosody volume='x-soft'>very soft</prosody>. I can speak <prosody rate='x-fast'>a lot words in a very very very fast speed</prosody> or to speak <prosody rate='x-slow'>in a very slow speed</prosody>. I can speak <prosody pitch='x-high'>in a very high pitch</prosody> or speak <prosody pitch='x-low'>in a very low pitch</prosody></speak>"
